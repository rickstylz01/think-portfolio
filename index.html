        <h2>About Rick</h2>
        <p>
          Working with an non-for-profit organization that helps students, specifically on the south side of Chicago, I relish the oppertunity to bring attention to topics and subjects that expand the horizons in the student's imaginations.  While taking a course on the Swift coding language, to introduce the students to coding and how apps are created, I found myself enjoying this new world of programming as much as the students and maybe even more so. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          As a new student at <i>Thinkful</i> I have begun my journey to becoming a software developer. This journey has also reinforced certain values that have helped me through the challenges along the way like:
          <ul class="center-list">
            <li>The toughest challenges reap the greatest rewards.</li>
            <li>It is ALWAYS ok to ask for help.</li>
            <li>Sometimes stepping away, to come back with a fresh perspective, can be key. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are looking to hire a new developer, please reach out!  I am excited for what the future holds and I can't wait to get there!
